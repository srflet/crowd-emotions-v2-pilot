                On the screen, you will briefly see a group of faces. These
                faces are of the same person, but with different emotions. For
                instance, in the example below, some faces are angrier than
                others.

                You will be presented with a visual image for a brief period and
                will be asked a question about that image. Below is an example
                of a visual image.
