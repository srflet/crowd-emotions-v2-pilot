          </p>

          <h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of this research is to examine emotional recognition.
          </p>

          <h3>Why have I been invited to participate?</h3>
          <p>
            We are inviting you to participate in this study because you are at
            least 18 years old, speak English, and able to give informed
            consent.
          </p>

          <h3>Do I have to participate?</h3>
          <p>
            Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You may withdraw
            participation at any time for any reason without adverse effect.
          </p>

          <h3>What will happen to me if I take part?</h3>
          <p>
            We kindly ask you to participate in a visual search study where you
            try to remember as much visual information as you possibly can in a
            short period of time. The entire study should take about {time}{" "}
            mins, and you will receive both a base pay and a performance-based
            compensation.
          </p>

          <h3>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h3>
          <p>
            There are no risks or discomforts associated with participating in
            this research study.
          </p>

          <h3>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3>
          <p>
            You will be compensated for you time. You will receive a base
            payment of ${flatPay} for completing the study and you may obtain a
            bonus of up to ${bonusPay} based on your performance. Otherwise,
            there are no other direct benefits to you from participating in this
            research. Some potential benefits include learning more about
            research. We hope that, in the future, other people might benefit
            from this study through improved understanding of workplace
            interactions.
          </p>

          <h3>What if something goes wrong?</h3>
          <p>

            that you would like to notify the researcher about, please contact
            the principal researcher at tom.yan@ucl.ac.uk
          </p>

          <h3>Will my taking part in this study be kept confidential?</h3>
          <p>
            Your responses will be fully anonymized and safely stored to protect
            your confidentiality. No one will be able to identify you based on
            the responses you provide. Your Prolific ID will be kept securely
            and will be deleted from the data once compensation has been
            provided. The Prolific IDs will be replaced by randomly generated
            IDs to guarantee anonymity.
          </p>

            academic publications or made openly available for other researchers
            on platforms such as GitHub or OSF.
